In this guide, we utilize a custom `Stepper` component, specifically designed for AriaDocs, which enables users to display step-by-step instructions directly within the markdown render.

## Preview

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Clone the AriaDocs Repository">
    Start by cloning the AriaDocs repository from GitHub. Open your terminal,
    navigate to the desired directory, and run the command `git clone
    https://github.com/DEVRhylme-Foundation/AriaDocs.git` to download the
    project files.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Access the Project Directory">
    Navigate to the project directory using your terminal. For example, if you
    cloned the repository into a folder named "AriaDocs," run `cd AriaDocs` to
    switch to the project folder.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Install Required Dependencies">
    Install all the necessary dependencies to ensure the project runs smoothly.
